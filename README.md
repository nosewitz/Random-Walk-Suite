# Random-Walk-Suite

Visualizations of Random Walks.

HOW TO USE:

1. Download Julia, if using Windows you can access it from the Windows store. I recommend Juliaup (this was developed using Julia 1.8.5)

2. Download this repository and extract into a folder

3. Start up Julia in this directory

4. Once Julia is running, type "]" to enter the package manager. Once in here, type "activate .", this will read the Project.toml and Manifest files to match the environment.

5. Next, go back to the regular REPL and type, "Using Pluto; Pluto.run();" This will start up Pluto and the notebook will be accessible underneath, titled "Demo.jl". If "Using Pluto" errors, then download the package by entering the package manager and inputting "add Pluto".
